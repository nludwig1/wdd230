            <h3>
                This website exemplifies proximity by putting images close
                together with captions. This shows that they
                are
                tied together.
                in this example, the caption "What to expect at church" isn't only tied to gether with the Caption
                above
                it,
                but the link below it.

            <h3>This site shows the Rule of thirds by splitting the products it shows in three distinct columns. On the
                left
                most,
                recently viewed items, and half of an ad for spongebob. Column two, zorro and the other half of
                spongebob,
                the third, some ads.
                it then has three rows going down the page.

            <h3>White Space is shown on family search by using the image,
                and using a gradiant to a lightish blue to the
                captions and search bar.
                even though it's just a blank space, it is still utilized with the image fading out to the
                color
